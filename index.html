            <h4>Project: Don’t talk, emoji it</h4>

            <p>Background: Emoji is a popular language using by people from different language background. The emoji meaning is often richer than a single word in English which make it easy to read but hard to write. Hence, we need help from Machine Learning. </p>
            <p>Project Description: An unsupervised Word2Vec model exploring the usage similarity between emoji and English words on twitter. In order to acheive better performance, we ensemble the CBOW algorithm and Skip-gram algorithm. Provided a real-time APP on AWS cloud and collected user feedback to server database.</p>
            <p>Tools: Python(BeatifulSoup, NLTK, Gensim, Pydash), AWS EC2, PostgreSQL</p>

            <h4>Project: Analysis on Customer Lifetime Value</h4>

            <br>
            <img src="img/CLTV.png" ALIGN=”right”>
            <p>Background: A question is often asked when I was helping the marketing team developing strategy, which is HOW MUCH CAN I VALUE A CUSTOMER. The amount customer brought in the past does not imply they will have the exact same in the future. We need to know when will they buy and how much they will buy.</p>
            <p>Project Description: An ensemble probabilistic model(CLTV) could handle this problem very well which not only able to predict how much a customer will buy in any future periods but also the probability he or she will buy in a time range. Also, by comparing with classical machine learning methods, random forest, OLS, and SVM, the CLTV model has the best performance in prediction RMSE.</p>
            <p>Tools: Python(PySpark, Lifetime, SKlearn-linear regression, random forest, support vector machine), Spark, SQL</p>

            <p>Background: The motivation of this local COVID19 tracker came from early March 2020 the situation people kept ignoring the threat of the coronavirus. I, as a data scientist, believe I should remind people how COVID19 was kept growing rapidly.</p>
            <p>Project Description: Web-scraped the lastest figures from daily press releases of the LA public health department. After that, I created an interactive map showing the density and trend of local communities. By the local community map, I want to provide relevant information and wake people from getting numb with the large numbers.</p>
            <p>Tools: Python(BeatifulSoup, Folium, Altair), AWS EC2</p>
